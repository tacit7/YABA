# YABA - Yet Another Blog App

After doing a lot of maintanance for rails app. I've been missing creating apps from scratch. This is the reason for this blog app. It uses bootstrap for the UI components, rspec for testing, and bcrypt for authentication. 

This is your basic blog app. It has users which can also be authors and admins. It has categories and a join table for categories and articles.
